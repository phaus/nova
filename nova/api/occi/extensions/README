To create OCCI extensions:

 1. Define the method to retreive all extension information. This method 
    **must** have the following signature:
        def get_extensions()
    It **must** return a list. That list **must** contain at least one
    dict. The dict **must** contain a pyssf backend handler. The dict
    **must** also contain a list of OCCI Categories that are handled by the
    pyssf backend handler. The OCCI Categories and pyssf backend handler 
    **should** be defined in the same python file
 
 2. Define the extension categories. Depending on your needs you can define
    Kind, Mixin, Link or Action extensions.
 
 3. Define the extension handler(s). 
 
 Examples of OCCI extensions can be found in the same directory as this README
 file.
     fiware.py - this includes a very basic extension
     occi_future.py - this includes extensions that are considered as future
                      OCCI-WG extensions 
     openstack.py - this includes various OpenStack specific extensions

 All extensions are enumerated via __init__.py and loaded via wsgi.py
